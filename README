# Toxicity Analysis for Talk Edit page in Wikipedia

Built a text classifier from scratch using NLP text processing and the Support vector classifier (SVC) model in Python to determine toxic comments in 
the Talk edit pages on Wikipedia for a 70:30 data set split on the Wikipedia comments dataset acquired from Kaggle. 
      
Used a Grid search model to Hyper-parameter tunning to optimize the SVC model which resulted in an 86% accuracy in toxic text classification.

Purpose of the project was to build the model from scratch to learn the model building libraries and processes in the NLP and how to evaluate
and fine-tune them despite the availability of various pretrained libraries based on large data.
