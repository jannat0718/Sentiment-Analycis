# Toxicity Analysis for Talk Edit page in Wikipedia

Built a text classifier from scratch using NLP text processing and the Support vector classifier (SVC) model in Python to determine toxic comments in 
the Talk edit pages on Wikipedia for a 70:30 data set split on the Wikipedia comments dataset acquired from Kaggle. 
      
Used a Grid search model to Hyper-parameter tunning to optimize the SVC model which resulted in an 86% accuracy in toxic text classification.

Purpose of the project was to build the model from scratch to learn the model building libraries and processes in the NLP and how to evaluate
     and fine-tune them despite the availability of various pretrained libraries based on large data.

# Twitter Sentimment Analysis Using TextBlob libraries
  
Built a Sentiment Analysis model using TextBlob which is a lexicon-based approach where sentiment is measured by the semantic orientation and intensity 
of each word in the sentence.TextBlob produces a sentiment polarity score between -1 to +1 to measure how negative or positive a sentence is and also a
subjectivity score to measure how opinionated a sentence is.

Threshold setting for sentiment class division: Negative <0 
                                                Neutral ==0
                                                Positive >0
                                                
Using the threshold the percentage of Positive comments obtained was almost 50% , 15% for Negative comments and 35% Neutral.
